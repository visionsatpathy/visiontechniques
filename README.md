# MNIST Digit Classification using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

## Overview

This project implements a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The code demonstrates the fundamental concepts of feedforward neural networks, including model definition, training, evaluation, and visualization of intermediate outputs.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset.
- Defines and compiles an MLP model with one hidden layer.
- Trains the model on the training data and validates it using a portion of the training set.
- Evaluates the model's performance on the test set and prints the accuracy.
- Visualizes the training and validation accuracy over epochs.
- Displays a sample test image and prints the activations of each layer for that image.
- Visualizes the activations of the hidden layer and the output layer.

## Requirements

To run this code, you will need the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
